            Carrot cake is my #1 favorite cake. Growing up, my mom made it for my birthday every year
            and the only thing that competed was a batch of carrot cake cupcakes on the side.<br> 
            I’ve adopted this tradition and make my own carrot birthday cake each year. 
            And, of course, we never limit it to only once per year.<br> 
            This cake graces our Easter table and I love making it for spring brunches, baby showers,
            and our community’s new bake sale.<br> fact, this carrot cake recipe is so popular around here 
            that I stopped asking what everyone wants for dessert! Because it’s always this!<br>

        <h3><span id="blue">What does this carrot cake taste like?</span></h3>
        <div class="panda">
            This carrot cake sets the standard for carrot cakes everywhere.<br>
            It’s deeply moist and filled with toasted pecans. Most of its flavor comes from brown sugar, 
            cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and carrots.<br> 
            Ginger adds the most delicious zing, but it isn’t overpowering at all.<br> 
            The cake is dense, but each forkful tastes super soft and extra lush.<br> 
            If made ahead, the flavor intensifies and the cream cheese frosting seeps into the layers, 
            creating an even more tender bite.<br>
