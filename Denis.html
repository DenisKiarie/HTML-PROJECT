            <ul>
                <li>2 cups (260g) chopped pecans (1 cup for cake, 1 cup for garnish. Nuts are optional.)</li>

        <h3><span id="pink">Instructions.</span></h3>
        <div class="panther">
            <ol>
                <li><b>Make the cake:</b>Preheat oven to 300°F (149°C).<br> 
                    Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.<br> 
                    Spread the chopped pecans on the sheet and toast for 7-8 minutes.<br> 
                    Remove from the oven and allow to cool for 10-15 minutes.<br></li><br>
                <li>Turn the oven up to 350°F (177°C).<br> 
                    Grease two or three 9-inch cake pans, line with parchment paper, then grease the parchment paper.<br> 
                    Parchment paper helps the cakes seamlessly release from the pans.<br></li><br>
                <li>Whisk the brown sugar, granulated sugar, oil, eggs, applesauce, and vanilla together in a large bowl until combined and no brown sugar lumps remain.<br> 
                    In another large bowl, whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and cloves together.<br> 
                    Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and, using a rubber spatula or wooden spoon, fold the ingredients together until just combined.<br> 
                    Fold in the carrots and 1 cup of the toasted pecans. (The rest of the pecans are for garnish.)<br></li><br>
                <li>Pour/spoon the batter evenly into the cake pans.<br> 
                    If using three cake pans, bake for 20-24 minutes.<br> 
                    If using two cake pans, bake for 30-35 minutes.<br> 
                    Test the center with a toothpick.<br> 
                    If it comes out clean, the cakes are done.<br> 
                    If not, continue to bake until cooked through. Do not over-bake.<br> 
                    Allow the cakes to cool completely in the pans set on a wire rack.<br> 
                    The cakes must be completely cool before frosting and assembling.<br></li><br>
                <li><b>Make the frosting:</b>In a large bowl using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a whisk or paddle attachment,<br> 
                    beat the cream cheese and butter together on medium-high speed until smooth, about 2 minutes.<br> 
                    Add the confectioners’ sugar, vanilla extract, and a pinch of salt.<br> 
                    Beat on low speed for 30 seconds, then increase to high speed and beat for 3 minutes until completely combined and creamy.<br> 
                    Add more confectioners’ sugar if frosting is too thin, a little milk if frosting is too thick, or an extra pinch of salt if frosting is too sweet.<br> 
                    Frosting should be soft, but not runny.<br></li><br>
                <li><b>Assemble and frost:</b>First, using a large serrated knife or cake leveler, layer off the tops of the cakes to create a flat surface.<br> 
                    Place 1 cake layer on your cake stand or serving plate.<br> 
                    Evenly cover the top with frosting.<br> 
                    Top with 2nd layer, more frosting, and then top with the 3rd layer.<br> 
                    Spread remaining frosting all over the top and sides.<br> 
                    Decorate the sides and top of the cake with the remaining toasted pecans.<br> 
                    Refrigerate cake for at least 15-20 minutes before slicing.<br> 
                    This helps the cake hold its shape when cutting.<br></li><br>
                <li>Cover leftover frosted cake tightly and store in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.</li><br>
            </ol>
